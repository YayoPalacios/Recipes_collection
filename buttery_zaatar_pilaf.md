# Buttery za'atar & almond pilaf 

**Ingredients:**

- 300g Basmati Rice
- 3 Onions
- 150g Butter or Ghee
- 1 Tbsp Zaâ€™atar
- 375ml Veg or Chicken Stock
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Lemon
- 3 Tbsp Toasted Flaked Almonds
- Handful of Fresh Mint Leaves
- Yoghurt to Serve
- Olive Oil, Salt, Black Pepper

**Method:**

**1. Caramelizing Onions:**
   - In a lidded pot (approximately 24cm), melt the butter or ghee over medium-high heat.
   - Add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 9-10 minutes until deeply caramelized and starting to crisp. This process may take a bit longer due to the water content in butter; keep stirring to prevent burning.

**2. Toasting Rice:**
   - Once the onions are caramelized, remove them from the pot, leaving behind the browned butter. 
   - Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the rinsed rice. Stir vigorously to coat the grains with butter. 
   - Toast the rice for 4-5 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden.

**3. Seasoning and Cooking:**
   - Add za'atar, half of the cooked onions, and a pinch of salt to the rice. Stir to combine.
   - Pour in the chicken stock and increase the heat to high. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 14 minutes without lifting the lid.

**4. Garnishing:**
   - While the rice is cooking, scatter the toasted almonds, julienned carrot, lemon zest, remaining caramelized onions, and mint leaves over the rice.
   - Squeeze the juice of the lemon over the rice.
   - Cover the pot and let it rest off the heat for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld and the rice to set.

**5. Serving:**
   - Serve the pilaf on warm plates, accompanied by yogurt.
